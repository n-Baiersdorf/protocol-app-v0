\section{Zielsetzung}%
\label{sec:Zielsetzung}%
The aim of this experiment is to determine the titration of an acid with a base using a standardized procedure.
THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
Titration is a common analytical technique used to determine the concentration of a substance, such as an acid or a base, by reacting it with a known quantity of another substance, called the titrant. The reaction is usually accompanied by a change in the physical or chemical properties of the system, which can be measured and used to determine the concentration of the original substance.

\section{Materialien und Geräte}%
\label{sec:MaterialienundGerte}%
* 10 mL of unknown acid solution
* 10 mL of base solution (sodium hydroxide)
* Pipettes (1 mL and 10 mL)
* Burettes (25 mL and 100 mL)
* Thermometer
* Stopwatch

\section{Durchführung}%
\label{sec:Durchfhrung}%
1. Measure 10 mL of the unknown acid solution into a clean beaker.
2. Measure 10 mL of the base solution (sodium hydroxide) into a second clean beaker.
3. Using a pipette, slowly add the base solution to the acid solution in the first beaker while stirring with a glass rod.
4. Continue adding the base solution until the reaction is complete, which is indicated by the appearance of a permanent blue color in the solution.
5. Measure the volume of the added base solution using a burette and record the volume as "X mL".
6. Measure the temperature of the solution at regular intervals during the titration using a thermometer and record the temperatures.
7. Use the stopwatch to measure the time taken for the reaction to complete.

\section{Ergebnisse und Beobachtungen}%
\label{sec:ErgebnisseundBeobachtungen}%
Observe the reaction carefully and note any changes in the physical or chemical properties of the solution, such as color change, frothing, or bubbling.

%
\section{Berechnungen und Auswertung}%
\label{sec:BerechnungenundAuswertung}%
Use the formula:
Volume of base solution = (Concentration of acid solution x Volume of acid solution) / (Molarity of base solution x 100)
to calculate the concentration of the unknown acid solution.

%
\section{Diskussion}%
\label{sec:Diskussion}%
Interpret the results of the titration and discuss any implications for the identity of the acid.

%
\section{Schlussfolgerung}%
\label{sec:Schlussfolgerung}%
Based on the results of the titration, determine the identity of the acid and record the conclusion in the laboratory notebook.
Please note that this is a simplified version of the protocol and may need to be adapted depending on the specific requirements of your experiment.
